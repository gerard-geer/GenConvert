GenConvert
==========
*a multi-platform Sega Genesis ROM conversion utility*

Usage
=====
It's pretty simple. Specify an input file and optionally an output file.
The utility will try to infer from file extensions what format you want to
convert from and to. Alternatively one can use the `-f` and `-t` flags to set
the from and to formats respectively.

If an output file is not specified, the output will be saved as `out.<ext>`,
where `<ext>` is the extension of the format being converted to. (This defaults
to `.bin` in the case of an explicit target format being omitted.)
